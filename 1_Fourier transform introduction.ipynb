    "## Minimal background\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a function $f(x)$, it's Fourier transform (FT) is given as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(s) = \\mathscr{F}\\{f(x)\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-i 2 \\pi x s} dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the inverse Fourier transform as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\mathscr{F}\\{F(s)\\}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(s) e^{i 2 \\pi s x} ds$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The eternal quiestion that plagues undergrads usually is, why can that $2\\pi$ just appear and disappear wherever it wants to be? That's because there are different conventions for the factor $2\\pi$ appearing in the transform formulas, they have everything to do with their proper normalization. Above, I've given the form I will stick to, if you want to see what's up with the other forms, check out the very first part of the \"Groundwork\" section in the Bracewell book. The only important thing is that once you pick one system, you stick to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables $x$ and $s$ are also used differently in different places. Classically, when talking about time domain signals, we would use $f(t)$ a function of time $t$ in time units (e.g. seconds) and $F(f)$ a function of frequency $f$ in frequency units (e.g. Hertz, $1Hz = 1s^{-1}$). This is true for any sort of signal though, and the second most used situation is linear units and spatial frequencyes, where $f(x)$ is a function of linear units (e.g. meters) and its FT $F(s)$ is a function of spatial frequency $s$ (e.g. $m^{-1}$). This is what is widely used in image processing (although the choice of linear units varies), so we sill stick to that, since we will be using Fourier analysis in the context of optics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind all of this is the fundamental statement that any signal, temporal or spatial, can be represented as a superposition of sinusoidal signals - sines and cosines. The first link I put on the top of this notebook (link [1]) tries to give an intuitive understanding of this. Link [2] also illustrates this in its section on Fourier series, which shows us that we can decompose any peroidic function into a sum of sines and cosines. The Fourier Transform is the extension of this idea to non-periodic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at our definition of a FT above, we can say that the FT $F(s)$ tells us how much power the function $f(x)$ contains at the frequency $s$ and $F(s)$ is called the **spectrum** of $f(x)$. $f(x)$ and $F(s)$ for a **Fourier pair**, they are distinct representations of the same underlying identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will be working in $\\mathbb{C}$, where $f(x)$ is a **complex function** and $F(s)$ is a complex function. (I'm not bothering with the fancy math notations here, because I'm human and human words sometimes make more sense than weird symbols, even if it takes way longer to get to the point.) Since real functions are a subset of complex functions, Fourier transforms of real functions will have some special behavior that we will also be looking at. If you need a primer on complex numbers, there's one here:\n",

    "And the introcudtion of link [2] is pretty neat for these concepts as well. I just don't see a point of repeating that information in here if I can already find it over there."

    "## About these notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple things are called simple for a reason, but it is really annoying when you can't find a nice explanation or visualization of something because everybody just assumes it is simple, so we don't need to explain it. I didn't like that, especially since I like going back to the basics sometimes, no matter how simple they're perceived to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is specifically true when those simple things are the basis for a more complicated topic, like Fourier Optics. Fourier Optics is really cool, but without knowing the basics, you won't get far. And in order to learn the basics, you need to be able to look them up somewhere... So, I thought, I could start making notebooks as I go back to those simple things while exploring the world of Fourier Optics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is neither a full treatment nor even a full overview, but merely a collection of illustrations and explanationsn of things I like to be able to come back to. I have tried to make the notebooks build on top of each other in terms of what you need to know for the next step, but this will not always hold true.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks also build greatly on external material. I am not here because I think I can explain all these things better, but because I wanted to make a collection of notes and resources with which I personally understood these topics better. And I am sharing them, because maybe somebody would find this ueseful.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last note: why notebooks? I work with Fourier Optics in Python and a lot of what I am talking about in the notebooks is the numerical treatment of Fourier Analysis, hence I decided to showcase my materials collection in Python. It also helps me to have a code basis I can come back to."
